This is a simple adaptation of https://github.com/timothybrooks/hdr-plus,
by Timothy Brooks and Suhaas Reddy, with minimal changes added to wrap the
code in a Generator and allow for disabling manual scheduling
(for auto-schedule purposes), and some constant matrices were converted from
Funcs to inlined constant Buffers; code dealing with reading Raw files (via dcraw)
has been omitted.

It has been renamed "hdr_plaid" here to avoid any possible confusion with
Google's HDR+ code (with which it shares no code).
