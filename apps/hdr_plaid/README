This is a simple adaptation of https://github.com/timothybrooks/hdr-plus,
by Timothy Brooks and Suhaas Reddy, with minimal changes added to wrap the
code in a Generator and allow for disabling manual scheduling
(for auto-schedule purposes); code dealing with reading Raw files (via dcraw)
has been omitted.

It has been renamed "hdr_plaid" here to avoid any possible confusion with
Google's HDR+ code (with which it shares no code).

Additional modifications were made to make the code more idiomatic
Halide. Small constant Funcs (e.g. convolution kernels and color
matrices) were rewritten to use embedded Buffers instead of Func with
lots of trivial update definitions, and demosaic_output was rewritten
to use a select tree instead of an large strided RDom, which forces 9
compute_root passes over that one Func and makes it impossible to
schedule well for humans or autoscheduling algorithms.
